# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a tool that allows you to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups in your code. It's useful when working on teams as well as when working on personal projects to tracj changes/progress and to debug errors, as needed.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch in Git gives you essentially a copy of your current project to work on. You use branches when adding new features, rather than automatically adding them to the master branch, so that you can keep track of individual changes.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point when working on a project. A good commit message is detailed and states what was changed since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict happens when there is a discrepancy in a line (or lines) of code between two different branches, and it is unknown which version should/should not be used. Thus, there's a pause in the merge process when trying to resolve the conflict.
